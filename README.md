```
rails db:migrate
```

```
rails server

## Testing

> We are using [RSpec testing tool](https://rspec.info/) for testing. Also some detailed [documentation](https://relishapp.com/rspec/docs) about this tool.
And [Capybara](http://teamcapybara.github.io/capybara/) with SeleniumChrome Driver to integration tests

### Install & setting up environment 

1. Let‚Äôs add the following to our Gemfile under the `:development` and `:test` group.
    ```
    # The RSpec testing framework
    gem 'rspec-rails'

    # Capybara, the library that allows us to interact with the browser using Ruby
    gem 'capybara'

    # The following gems aids with the nuts and bolts
    # of interacting with the browser.
    gem 'webdrivers'
    ```

2. Install Rspec

    Although we‚Äôve already installed the RSpec gem, we haven‚Äôt installed RSpec into our application. 
    ```
    $ rails g rspec:install
    ```

3. Add the following to the bottom of `spec/rails_helper.rb:`

    ```
    Capybara.default_driver = :selenium_chrome
    ```


    Check [these instructions](https://www.codewithjason.com/rails-testing-hello-world-using-rspec-capybara/) if you have problems.

### Run

- Whether it's integration or unit test, create a file `<your name file>_spec.rb`
- Write some rules to run your test.(Check Capybara [documentation](https://rubydoc.info/github/teamcapybara/capybara/master) )
- Open a Terminal window and then run this block code
`rspec spec/<you directory path>/<your file name>.rb`
- Check if your test passed or it's throwing errors

## Deployment on Heroku

In beforehand you have had committed all your changes

1. In your terminal run to create a Heroku Application
    ```
    heroku create
    ```
2. Configure the Gemfile
    To deploy a Rails application, we need to change some settings.

    First, we need to open the Gemfile and edit it.
    When VSCode opens, you should see a list of files on the left side of the screen. Click on Gemfile to open it in the editor. Then, delete the line that says, `gem 'sqlite3'` and replace the line you just deleted with the following:
    ```
    group :development, :test do
    gem 'sqlite3'
    end

    group :production do
    gem 'pg'
    end
    ```
3. Install bundle   
    Next, we need to tell Ruby, Git, and Heroku that we‚Äôve changed the Gemfile. To do this, we can simply run

    ```
    bundle install --without production
    ```
4. Push to Heroku
    Now that we‚Äôve committed the files, we can push to Heroku:
    ```
    git push heroku master
    ```
5. Migrate the Database on Heroku
    Similar to what we did locally before we launched our app, we need to migrate the database on Heroku, which we can do with the Heroku CLI.

    Run this command:

    ```
    heroku run rails db:migrate
    ```
6. Visit your new application

    It‚Äôs time to see your app on the web! If you are using Linux or Mac, you can quickly open your app with the command below. If you are using WSL it will not open automatically, however, you will get an error message containing the link to copy and paste in your browser:

    ```
    heroku open
    ```

    Check [these instructions](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/your-first-rails-application-ruby-on-rails?ref=lnav#step-3-deploy-your-rails-application) if you have problems.

## Improvements

Features we are going to add to this app:
- Popping up a message when the budget for a festival has reached out
- Adding also web design to have both web and mobile designs
- Save in media management server (Cloudinary or S3) images and all media-related
